Tesselator program.  python prototype.  requires scipy and opencv2.4.9 (opencv3.0.0 beta doesnt support SURF or SIFT, which i learned the hard way aka spending an hour installing from source ;_;). 
ultimately id like to be able to tesselate images in such a way that they become a good subject for a tattoo, like http://blog.mugnai.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fox.jpg.
